I like to call this little story "Desvelados" maybe for a silly reason, but I think it sums up well what happened. It was the February-June 2023 semester at Tec de Monterrey, San Luis Potosí campus. We were in the last period of classes, and it was Friday of the penultimate week. Naturally, several people were still at the campus late into the evening, among them the protagonists of this story—two of my closest friends, "Andres and Pez," and, of course, me.

The three of us lived relatively far from campus. Pez and I usually spent over an hour commuting to our foreign houses, but in this case, Andres was always our savior since, being a local, he had a car and could drop us off as close to our homes as possible.

That night, we were up late working on some pending assignments. In my case, I had to submit the final project for my elective, which, for all the wrong reasons, I had procrastinated until the last minute. We decided it was time to leave—it was around 9:30 PM. Thanks to Andres driving us, the commute was cut to about half an hour. I had made good progress on my project, so with the time I had left, I was on track to finish everything in order. What could go wrong?

We left campus, and due to the location of Tec, we had to take several bridges to get home faster. I was usually in charge of playing the music during the ride, and given the time and situation, I thought it would be a good idea to play the song "Desvelado" by Bobby Pulido. We were driving through the city of San Luis, living in the moment; everything was going perfectly... but what was that smell? A strong burnt smell started to fill the air. Just as we began to descend one of the many bridges, it felt like we were driving on a dirt road; the car started bouncing, and we got scared. We reached the end of the bridge and pulled over to a section of an avenue, which wasn’t the best place to stop. We checked and... it was the tire. One of the tires was completely shredded.

Well, it wasn't that bad, right? We just had to change the tire with the spare, and we'd be good to go. However, the problem was that Andres had to change a tire a few weeks earlier, used the spare, and never replaced it. So we had no tire. Then we realized we didn’t have a jack either. And the worst part—none of us had any credit on our phones to call anyone for help.

At that moment, my biggest concern wasn’t being stranded there but rather my project. I was running out of time to finish it, and I had no way to access my document since it was backed up in the cloud. As we tried to figure out what to do, as if by a miracle, I got a call—once again, my mom saving me. She called to ask me something random, but it was perfect timing for me to explain the situation and ask for a phone recharge.

With the recharge, we could call Andres’ family. His brother, father, and even an uncle came to our rescue, but help wasn’t immediate. We spent a couple of hours waiting as Andres' family members went back and forth. With what I could remember, I started writing the missing parts of my project in the phone’s notes, but there were still things I needed from the document.

Finally, after approximately two hours of what was supposed to be a half-hour journey, we arrived home. I did the fastest speedrun of my life to finish and submit my project, sending it in with two minutes to spare. The night ended with a well-deserved late-night taco dinner.
