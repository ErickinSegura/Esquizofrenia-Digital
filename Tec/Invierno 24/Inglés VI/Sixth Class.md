## Active and passive voice

In the realm of English grammar, the use of active and passive voice adds a layer of nuance to the way we express actions and convey information. Understanding the distinctions between these two voices is crucial for effective communication and writing.

##### Active Voice 
In the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. The structure typically follows the order of subject-verb-object.

__Example: "The chef (subject) _prepared_ (verb) a delicious meal (object)." In this sentence, the chef is the doer of the action.

Active voice is often preferred for its clarity and directness, making it evident who or what is responsible for the action.

##### Passive Voice
In contrast, the passive voice shifts the focus from the doer of the action to the recipient or the result of the action. The structure often follows the order of object-verb-subject.

__Example: "A delicious meal (object) _was prepared_ (verb) by the chef (subject)." Here, the emphasis is on the meal rather than the chef.

While passive voice can be useful in specific contexts, such as when the doer of the action is unknown or when emphasizing the result, it is generally considered less direct and may lead to ambiguity.

##### Identifying Active and Passive Voice
To discern between active and passive voice, consider the position of the subject and the structure of the sentence. In active voice, the subject is the doer of the action, appearing before the verb. In passive voice, the subject comes after the verb or may not be explicitly mentioned.

##### Why Choose Active Voice

1. **Clarity:** Active voice provides clear and straightforward communication.
2. **Conciseness:** Active voice often requires fewer words, making sentences more concise.
3. **Engagement:** Active voice engages the reader by clearly identifying the agent of the action.

##### When to Use Passive Voice

1. **Unknown Doer:** When the doer of the action is unknown or irrelevant.
2. **Emphasizing the Result:** When the result or the action's recipient is more important than the doer.

## Simple past

In the intricate timeline of English grammar, the simple past tense emerges as a crucial element, allowing us to recount, describe, or express actions that occurred at a definite point in the past. Whether relaying personal experiences, historical events, or completed actions, the simple past tense serves as a linguistic compass guiding us through the bygone moments of time.

##### Formation of the Simple Past Tense
The structure of the simple past tense for regular verbs involves adding "-ed" to the base form of the verb. Irregular verbs, however, follow unique patterns, and their past forms must be memorized.

Example with regular verb "walk":

- __Present: I _walk_ to the park every day.
- __Simple Past: Yesterday, I _walked_ to the park.

Example with irregular verb "go":

- __Present: I _go_ to the market regularly.
- __Simple Past: Last week, I _went_ to the market.

##### Key Characteristics of the Simple Past Tense

1. **Definite Time in the Past:** The simple past tense is employed when referring to actions that occurred at a specific point or during a specific period in the past.
    
    __Example: "She _visited_ Paris last summer." The action of visiting took place in a defined period, last summer.
    
2. **Completed Actions:** It is used to indicate actions that have been fully completed in the past.
    
    __Example: "They _finished_ their project before the deadline." The completion of the project occurred in the past.
    
3. **Interrupted Actions:** The simple past tense can describe actions that were interrupted by another event in the past.
    
    __Example: "I _was reading_ a book when the phone _rang_." The act of reading was interrupted by the ringing phone.
    
4. **Habitual Actions in the Past:** It can be employed to express actions that were habitual or repeated in the past.
    
    __Example: "Every Saturday, we _played_ board games as a family." The habitual action of playing board games occurred every Saturday.
    

##### Regular vs. Irregular Verbs
Regular verbs adhere to a consistent pattern when forming the simple past tense, making use of the "-ed" suffix. Irregular verbs, however, follow unique patterns, and their past forms often require memorization.
