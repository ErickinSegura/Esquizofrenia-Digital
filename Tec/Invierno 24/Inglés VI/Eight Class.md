## Gradable and non gradable adjectives

In the expansive realm of language, adjectives play a pivotal role in painting vivid images and conveying nuanced meanings. Among the diverse categories of adjectives, two distinct types—gradable and non-gradable—serve to express degrees of qualities in varied ways, offering a spectrum of description and precision.

##### Gradable Adjectives
Gradable adjectives are those that can express different degrees or levels of a quality. These adjectives are often modified by adverbs of degree, such as "very," "quite," or "extremely," to intensify or diminish the quality being described.

_Examples:_

1. _Cold (gradable):_ The weather can be slightly cold, very cold, or extremely cold.
2. _Beautiful (gradable):_ The sunset was quite beautiful, but the sunrise was absolutely stunning.

In gradable adjectives, the intensity or extent of the quality can be adjusted to provide a more nuanced and precise description.

##### Non-gradable Adjectives
Non-gradable adjectives, on the other hand, describe qualities that are considered absolute or inherent, leaving little room for degrees. These adjectives typically represent qualities that are either present or absent, without shades of intensity.

_Examples:_

1. _Empty (non-gradable):_ A container is either empty or not; there are no degrees of emptiness.
2. _Dead (non-gradable):_ An organism is either alive or dead, with no intermediary states.

Non-gradable adjectives often denote qualities that are binary or categorical, allowing for clear distinctions without the need for modifiers.

##### Navigating the Spectrum
Understanding the distinction between gradable and non-gradable adjectives is crucial for effective communication. Gradable adjectives enable speakers and writers to convey subtle nuances and degrees of a quality, adding layers to descriptions. Non-gradable adjectives, on the other hand, offer clarity and precision in expressing qualities that lack varying degrees.

##### Degrees of Comparison
While gradable adjectives easily accommodate degrees of comparison (positive, comparative, and superlative), non-gradable adjectives typically do not follow this pattern, as their qualities are often absolute.

_Example of comparison with a gradable adjective:_

- _Positive:_ The mountain is high.
- _Comparative:_ Mount Everest is higher than most other mountains.
- _Superlative:_ Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world.

_Example of a non-gradable adjective:_

- _Positive:_ The glass is full.
- _Comparative and Superlative:_ These concepts are not applicable because "full" is a non-gradable adjective.

## Intensifying Adverbs

In the symphony of language, adverbs contribute a dynamic melody, and among them, intensifying adverbs stand out as the crescendos, adding depth and vigor to the expression of qualities. These adverbs play a vital role in amplifying the degree or intensity of an adjective, verb, or another adverb, lending emphasis and vividness to our descriptions and narratives.

##### Defining Intensifying Adverbs
Intensifying adverbs are a category of adverbs that modify and enhance the meaning of other words by emphasizing their degree or intensity. These adverbs often answer the question "to what extent" and are crucial in conveying the strength, emphasis, or extremity of a particular quality.

_Examples:_

1. _Very:_ She was **very** pleased with the outcome of the project.
2. _Extremely:_ The concert was **extremely** loud and energetic.
3. _Incredibly:_ The athlete performed **incredibly** well during the competition.

**Common Intensifying Adverbs:**

1. **Very:** Adds a high degree of intensity or emphasis.
2. **Extremely:** Emphasizes to the highest degree, often implying an extreme level.
3. **Incredibly:** Suggests a high degree of something, often with a sense of awe or surprise.
4. **Absolutely:** Emphasizes total agreement or the completeness of an action or quality.
5. **Utterly:** Indicates complete and total action or state.

##### Placement in Sentences
Intensifying adverbs are typically placed before the adjective, adverb, or verb they modify. This placement ensures that the emphasis is clearly linked to the intended word or phrase.

_Examples:_

1. The journey was **very** challenging.
2. She worked **extremely** hard on the project.
3. The performance was **incredibly** impressive.

##### Degrees of Intensity
Intensifying adverbs can convey varying degrees of intensity, allowing for subtle nuances in expression. Adverbs like "very" may indicate a moderate degree, while stronger adverbs like "extremely" or "utterly" suggest a more forceful or complete intensity.

_Example with varying degrees:_

- The coffee is **very** hot.
- The coffee is **extremely** hot.
- The coffee is **utterly** scalding.

##### Usage in Writing and Speech
Intensifying adverbs enrich both written and spoken language by providing a spectrum of emphasis and intensity. Writers use them to evoke emotions, paint vivid images, or emphasize key points. In speech, these adverbs contribute to effective communication by highlighting the speaker's stance or adding fervor to their expression.
